The story is taking place in a far away kingdom, where everybody (usually) lives happily.
But in a one bright day, suddenly, a cruel virus attacks and spreads throughout the kingdom.

Since this kingdom is very happy and doubtfully democratic, the king decides that the news about the virus shouldn't get to the people. they're better off not knowing.

In order to accomplish his mission the king decides to write a proxy which will be mandatory for every citizen of the kingdom to use, and since he's forced to stay at his palace since the outbreak, the king are trusting you with this mission.
You'd better help the king because he doesn't like to be disappointed.
